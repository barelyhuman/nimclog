# nimclog

This is nim port of commitlog with a tighter scope

## Why ?

size, binary size.

also, to get better at nimlang

## Features

- Sort git's logs into `features, fixes, others`
- That's about it.

## Installation

I'm still testing the cross compiled binaries so you'll have to wait for it.
Till then, you can compile it on your system using `nim` or `nimble`

```sh
nimble build
# or
nim c src/nimclog.nim
```
